To compile and run my program:
1) Navigate to the proper file path using cd
2) Once there, compile the java file. For some reason there's a mismatch between the compiler and the JRE on Zeus, so you'll have to specify a build target, like so:

javac --release 11 glm98Project1.java

3) Once the file has been compiled, run it

java glm98Project1
